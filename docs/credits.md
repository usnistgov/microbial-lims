# Credits, Authorship, etc.

This work has been a collaboration between researchers from the 
[Biosystems and Biomaterials Division](https://www.nist.gov/mml/bbd) and the
[Office of Data and Informatics](https://www.nist.gov/mml/odi) at NIST.

## Authorship

In particular, the following people have contributed to the project:

- BBD:
	- [Kirsten Parratt](https://www.nist.gov/people/kirsten-parratt) has provided the
      majority of the "bench science" domain expertise and created the overall design
	  of the experimental templates and metadata structure 
	- [Sierra Miller](https://www.nist.gov/people/sierra-miller) has provided additional
	  technical support and coordination with the JPL 
	  [LabCAS](https://edrn.nci.nih.gov/data-and-resources/informatics/labcas-cancer-biomarker-data-commons/training/labcas-general-overview/)
	  project
	- [Stephanie Servetas](https://www.nist.gov/people/stephanie-servetas) has provided
	  additional microbial domain expertise in template and metadata design
- ODI:
	- [Josh Taillon](https://www.nist.gov/people/joshua-taillon) has provided the
      majority of the technical implementation for ELabFTW and the original LinkML 
      schema implementation
	- [Arlin Stoltzfus](https://www.nist.gov/people/arlin-b-stoltzfus) has provided
	  additional technical support and data consulting

This project makes heavy use of the [LinkML](https://linkml.io/) data modeling framework
and the tooling it provides. It also relies on the [ELabFTW](https://elabftw.net)
electronic laboratory notebook platform for data entry and user interaction. The efforts
and assistance provided by the developers of both of these platforms are greatly
appreciated, including [Sierra Moxon](https://github.com/sierra-moxon),
[Chris Mungall](https://github.com/cmungall), and
[Nicolas Carpi](https://github.com/NicolasCARPi).
